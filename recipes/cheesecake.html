    <h2>A smooth and creamy cheesecake with strawberry jam</h2>
    <p>
        This cheesecake is a simple homemade recipe. It was created using multiple tests to focus on the perfect texture.
        while it is a mix of sweetness and crunchy with a slight hint of fruity added by the strawberry jam, it still has a subtle flavor so you can eat
        more than just one slice.

        Ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>Graham crackers - 12 sheets or 1.25 cups</li>
            <li>Melted butter - 5 table spoons</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar - 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Cream cheese - 1 brick</li>
            <li>Sweetend condensed milk - 1 can</li>
            <li>Pineapple juice - 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Strawberry jam</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
        </ul>
        Steps for the crust:
        <ol>
            <li>Crush the crackers - You can use a food processor, blender, or put them in a ziploc bag and use a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Mix the sugar - Add the sugar and the crumbs to a bowl and stir.</li>
            <li>Butter time - Add the melted butter to the bowl and stir it with a fork</li>
            <li>Check texture - Make sure everything is combined and lathered in butter.</li>
            <li>Press into the pan - Press the mixture into a pan so that it is tight against the bottom and sides then use your fingers to create an even edge</li>
            <li>Bake the crust - Bake at 350F for 10-13 minutes then allow to cool before adding filling.</li>
        </ol>
        Steps for filling:
        <ol>
            <li>Cream cheese - Add it to the bowl and get ready to beat the ingredients together</li>
            <li>Pour the fun stuff in - Add the sweetend condensed milk, pineapple juice, and vanilla extract into the bowl</li>
            <li>Beat it up! - Beat the ingredients together until most if not all of the cream cheese clumps are dissolved.</li>
            <li>Fill it up - Pour the filling into the pie crust</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven - 325F</li>
            <li>Baking Time! - once the oven is preheated bake the cheesecake for 20-25 minutes</li>
            <li>Checking the cheesecake - To check if it is ready tap the side gently, if the center jiggles a little it is complete</li>
            <li>(optional) Open the oven door after you turn it off, then leave the cheesecake for an hour so that is cools down gradually preventing cracks.</li>
            <li>Cool down - Take the cheesecake out and let it cool to room temperature</li>
            <li>Add strawberry jam and strawberries on top - this is up to your discretion</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
