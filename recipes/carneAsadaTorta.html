    <p>
        The torta is a traditional mexican food that uses a crusty white bread roll also knows as a "bolillo"
        Which is used to enhance the flavor of the sandwich due to its crunchy exterior and soft inside. 
        Many types of meat and ingredients are then added to enhance and change the flavor.
        The following recipe is one of my favorites due to its simplicity and flavor pallate.
